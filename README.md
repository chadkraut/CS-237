# CS-237
A few programs I wrote for Machine Organization &amp; Assembly Language Programming

Including the following:

prog1.s: this program converts user input (1-15) into latin

prog2.s: this program takes a data file (datafile.s) and solves (aX2 + 2bX2Y3 + cY2 - dX2Y)/(dX2 + eY2 +fxb) + 4Z2 - 2ad

prog3.s: this program takes a data file (datafile2.s, datafile3.s) and uses a radix sort to sort an array

prog4.s: this program uses getInput.h68, reduce.s, and GCD.s to reduce an user inputted fraction using a recursive subroutine
